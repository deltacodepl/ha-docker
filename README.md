These are my notes on how to install and configure Home Assistant using docker.

# What's Inside?
The docker-homeassistant stack contains everything you need for a stable Home Assistant experience running in Docker. To get started, all you is a Linux host running Docker.  This documentation generally assumes the use of [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) to manage the Docker instance.

Here is what this project has to offer:

1. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
1. [VSCode Editor](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-code-server/)
1. [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)
